# Win10, Docker & WSL2 performance issues

- Some resource intensive tasks such as compiling code and running services via `docker-compose` can cause stutters and hanging/blocking of WSL2-backed terminal and Windows desktop, even on a rather beefy machine.

- This is because WSL2 uses up all CPU and memory resources available to it but fails to release it once workload is complete.

- One workaround is to set resource limits on WSL2 by setting the following configuration in `.wslconfig` file:

```ini
[wsl2]
memory=8GB # Limits VM memory in WSL 2 to 4 GB
processors=4 # Makes the WSL 2 VM use four virtual processors
```

Place this in the Windows path `C:\Users\<username>\.wslconfig` and reboot.
Or restart the `vmmem` process by running the following in Powershell as Administrator: `Restart-Service LxssManager`.
