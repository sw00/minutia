## Questions

- Are you using the [Zettelkasten](https://www.zettlr.com/post/what-is-a-zettelkasten) method?

No. Although I'm using some of the tools, I am not following a formal process of note-taking and summarising. I am not a researcher nor do I intend to use these notes to write a book. Instead I'm just posting notes with no expectation, just to see what emerges.

- But isn't that essentially Zettelkasten?

Maybe. I don't know. Does it matter? I encounter a plethora of trivial details daily that need to go somewhere and deserve a place to live (and invariably die).
