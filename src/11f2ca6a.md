# Old versions of Ruby (<2.4) require libssl (~1.0)

- When building an older Ruby version via a version manager like `rvm`, `rbenv` or `asdf`, the build can fail trying to compile the openssl extension for Ruby:

```shell
make[2]: Entering directory '/tmp/ruby-build.20200715134812.9358.0dT5wr/ruby-2.1.2/ext/openssl'
... # build output omitted
make[2]: *** [Makefile:280: ossl_rand.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory '/tmp/ruby-build.20200715134812.9358.0dT5wr/ruby-2.1.2/ext/openssl'
make[1]: *** [exts.mk:186: ext/openssl/all] Error 2
```

- This is because the Ruby we're trying to compile might require an older `libssl` headers and library.
- We want to keep the up-to-date `libssl` that's installed on our system but be able to compile Ruby <2.4 successfully.

## Workaround
- Download the appropriate backported release of OpenSSL 1.0.x
  - E.g. [https://github.com/openssl/openssl/releases/tag/OpenSSL_1_0_2u](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/releases/tag/OpenSSL_1_0_2u)
- Configure and install the OpenSSL package to an appropriate dir:
  - the `shared` argument is necessary to also build `libssl` and `libcrypto`
```shell
export CFLAGS='-fpic'
./config --openssldir=/opt/openssl1.0.2u shared
make test
make install
```

- Install/compile Ruby with the appropriate flags to use the OpenSSL above:

```shell 
$ export RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=/opt/openssl1.0.2u --enable-shared"
$ asdf install ruby 2.1.2
```

- Install a valid `cacert.pem` to where Ruby expects it:

```shell
asdf shell ruby 2.1.2 # activate the ruby version
wget -O $(ruby -ropenssl -e 'puts OpenSSL::X509::DEFAULT_CERT_FILE') https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem
```
